1. after resetting the permission for npm, I still have the following errros:
	Haoyus-MBP:bin haoyuyu$ n stable
mkdir: /usr/local/n/versions/node: Permission denied
mkdir: /usr/local/n/versions/io: Permission denied

     install : node-v11.2.0
       mkdir : /usr/local/n/versions/node/11.2.0
mkdir: /usr/local/n/versions/node/11.2.0: Permission denied

  Error: sudo required

2. aftering installing ESLINT, I am not getting the errors as expected:
const hello = 'hello'; # this should gives an error for not using varible created.
