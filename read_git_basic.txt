Notes for git basics:

1. git init: this create a .git file that keep track of all the snapshots.
2. git status: check all the files status. 
3. git add
4. git commit -m "adding commit messages"
5. git remove -v: this shows what my remote url is connected to
6. origin is the convention of remote repository
7. copy others copy from github: this is called forking
8. github is not a version control system, but rather a collabration tool


notes for vscode:
1. go to directory and run code . to open vscode
2. control + ` # open and close integrated terminal in vscode

notes fix permission for npm 
1. sudo chown haoyuyu for npm implementation:
	Haoyus-MBP:Foundations haoyuyu$ sudo chown -R haoyuyu /usr/local/lib/node_modules  # (-R means recursively set the ownership) 
	Haoyus-MBP:Foundations haoyuyu$ sudo chown -R haoyuyu /usr/local/bin/
	Haoyus-MBP:Foundations haoyuyu$ sudo chown -R haoyuyu /usr/local/share/
	Haoyus-MBP:Foundations haoyuyu$ 

2. npm config get prefix # this get the npm dir

3. another way to reset the owner is to:
	a. mkdir /Users/haoyuyu/npm-global
        b. npm config set prefix /Users/haoyuyu/npm-global
	c. npm install -g jshint -> this will create a command "jshint", but we need to set path 
	d. vi ~/.profile -> add line export PATH=/Users/haoyuyu/npm-global/bin:$PATH
	e. source ~/.profile


notes for bash command:
1. ls -a : show all the files including .files-> which are configuration files.
